PROJECT TITLE: SQLGLM 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The objective of the project is to help the GridLAB-D developer keep track of the electrical objects 
in the project. These objects are described in the glm file. The program reads the file ecogrid.glm and creates an sqlite3 
database which includes tables for each type of electrical object and the way the objects are related to each other.
